Code Review Best Practices

Code review is essential for maintaining code quality and knowledge sharing. Here are key principles:

1. Review Code, Not People
Focus on the code itself, not the author. Be respectful and constructive in feedback. Remember that everyone makes mistakes and learns through iteration.

2. Automate What You Can
Use linters, formatters, and automated tests to catch mechanical issues. This frees reviewers to focus on logic, architecture, and design decisions.

3. Review Promptly
Timely reviews keep development flowing. Aim to review within 24 hours. If you need more time, acknowledge the request and provide a timeline.

4. Ask Questions
When you don't understand something, ask clarifying questions rather than assuming intent. This helps both reviewer and author learn.

5. Approve with Nits
For minor issues (nits), approve the PR and trust the author to fix them. Don't block progress on trivial matters.

6. Be Specific
Vague feedback like "this could be better" isn't helpful. Suggest specific improvements or alternatives.
