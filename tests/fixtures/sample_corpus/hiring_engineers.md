# Hiring Senior Engineers: What Actually Matters

After conducting over 200 engineering interviews and making some spectacular hiring mistakes, I've learned that what you optimize for in interviews determines who you hire - and who you miss.

## The Algorithm Trap

Stop asking candidates to reverse binary trees on a whiteboard. Unless your product is literally implementing data structures, you're testing the wrong skills.

What matters for senior engineers:
- **System design thinking** - Can they architect scalable systems?
- **Problem decomposition** - Can they break big problems into solvable pieces?
- **Communication** - Can they explain complex topics clearly?
- **Past impact** - What have they actually built?
- **Learning ability** - How do they approach unknown domains?

## The Behavioral Interview Framework

I use the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) but focus on specific probes:

**For technical judgment:**
"Tell me about a time you had to make a difficult architectural decision. What were the trade-offs? What would you do differently now?"

**For leadership:**
"Describe a situation where you had to influence a technical decision without authority. How did you approach it?"

**For growth mindset:**
"Tell me about a project that failed. What did you learn? How did that change your approach?"

Listen for specificity. Vague answers indicate lack of real experience.

## The Coding Exercise

If you must do coding exercises, make them realistic:
- Give them their own laptop
- Let them use Google
- Pair program with them
- Focus on working code over perfect code
- Discuss trade-offs, not just solutions

I give a 90-minute exercise building a small but complete feature. I care more about their process than their output. Do they write tests? How do they handle ambiguity? What questions do they ask?

## Red Flags

**Dismissive of others' work**
If a candidate trash-talks their current team or former colleagues, they'll do it to you too. Disagreement is fine; disrespect is not.

**Can't explain past decisions**
"We did it that way because the architect said so" indicates lack of critical thinking. Good engineers understand the why behind decisions.

**Overcomplicates simple things**
Smart engineers make complex things simple. Mediocre engineers make simple things complex. Watch for unnecessary abstraction.

**No questions for you**
If they don't ask thoughtful questions about the role, team, or tech stack, they're either not interested or not curious. Both are problems.

## Green Flags

**Owns mistakes**
"In retrospect, I should have..." shows growth mindset and self-awareness.

**Asks clarifying questions**
Good engineers seek to understand before solving. Lots of questions indicates careful thinking.

**Talks about team impact**
"We shipped..." not "I built..." suggests collaborative mindset.

**Specific about trade-offs**
"We chose X over Y because..." shows systems thinking and judgment.

## The Diversity Problem

Homogeneous teams build homogeneous products. Actively source diverse candidates:
- Partner with bootcamps and non-traditional programs
- Remove biased language from job descriptions
- Have diverse interview panels
- Look for potential, not just pedigree

The "culture fit" trap often means "people like us." Instead, hire for culture add - what new perspectives does this person bring?

## Compensation Strategy

Good engineers have options. Don't lowball. My approach:
1. Use market data (levels.fyi, Blind, etc.)
2. Make competitive first offers
3. Minimize back-and-forth negotiation
4. Be transparent about compensation philosophy

Trying to "save" $10K on a great hire is penny-wise and pound-foolish.

## The Pipeline Approach

Don't wait until you have an opening to build relationships. I:
- Attend tech meetups
- Speak at conferences
- Contribute to open source
- Write technical content
- Engage on Twitter/LinkedIn

When I have an opening, I have warm leads, not cold outreach.

## Retention Starts at Hiring

The best hiring decision is one that leads to long-term retention. I'm explicit in interviews about:
- Career growth paths
- Technical challenges ahead
- Team culture and values
- What success looks like in year 1

If these don't align with candidate expectations, better to find out now.

## The Final Interview Question

I always end with: "What haven't I asked that you wish I had?"

This reveals what they think is important and gives them a chance to share something they're proud of. The answers are often more revealing than my structured questions.

## Conclusion

Hiring is the highest leverage activity in engineering leadership. Every great hire multiplies your team's capabilities. Every bad hire drains morale and momentum.

Take your time. Define what you're actually looking for. Test for the right skills. And remember: hiring for potential beats hiring for credentials.
