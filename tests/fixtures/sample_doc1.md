# Engineering Leadership Principles

## Overview

Effective engineering leadership requires balancing technical excellence with people management.
Great leaders build high-performing teams through clear communication, trust, and empowerment.

## Technical Excellence

Leaders must maintain technical credibility while scaling their impact beyond individual contribution.
This means staying current with technology trends, making sound architectural decisions, and
mentoring others to grow their technical skills.

## Team Building

Building strong teams requires intentional effort in hiring, onboarding, and culture development.
Focus on psychological safety, clear goals, and continuous feedback. Celebrate wins and learn
from failures together.

## Communication

Clear communication is the foundation of effective leadership. Document decisions, share context
broadly, and ensure everyone understands the "why" behind the work. Regular 1:1s and team
meetings create alignment and trust.
