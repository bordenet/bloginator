# Career Development for Engineers

## Growth Mindset

Engineers thrive when they adopt a growth mindset. This means viewing challenges as opportunities
to learn, seeking feedback actively, and continuously expanding technical and leadership skills.

## Technical Depth vs Breadth

Early career engineers should focus on depth in one area to build expertise. As you progress,
broaden your skills across domains while maintaining depth in your specialty. Senior engineers
balance both effectively.

## Impact and Scope

Career progression is measured by increasing impact and scope. Junior engineers work on well-defined
tasks within a team. Senior engineers lead cross-team initiatives and influence organizational
direction through technical vision and mentorship.

## Leadership Opportunities

Leadership comes in many forms: technical leadership through architecture and design, people
leadership through management and mentorship, or project leadership through execution excellence.
Choose paths that align with your strengths and interests.
