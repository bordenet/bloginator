## The Three Classic Questions (And Why They're Not Enough)
The traditional format asks: What did you do yesterday? What will you do today? What's blocking you? While useful, this structure often devolves into mechanical status updates that miss the collaboration opportunity.

### Moving Beyond Status Reports
Effective standups shift focus from individual reporting to team problem-solving. Teams should discuss dependencies, offer help, and coordinate work rather than simply reciting task lists.

### Async Standups
For globally distributed teams, written updates in Slack or similar tools can replace synchronous meetings. Set clear expectations for update timing and format.

### Video vs. Audio vs. Text
Video provides the richest context but creates timezone challenges. Audio works for moderate time zone spreads. Text works best for maximal async flexibility.
