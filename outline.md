## Why Channel Naming Matters
Effective channel naming is the foundation of organized team communication. This section explores how consistent naming conventions reduce confusion, improve discoverability, and accelerate team onboarding. We'll examine real-world examples of channel sprawl and the productivity costs of poor naming practices.

## Core Naming Principles
Establish the fundamental rules that make channel names scannable, predictable, and actionable. This section covers length constraints (Microsoft Teams allows 50 characters), case sensitivity, special character handling, and the critical importance of consistency across your organization.

### Prefix Patterns for Context
Prefixes provide instant context about channel purpose and scope. Common patterns include: `proj-` for project channels, `team-` for department channels, `announce-` for broadcast-only channels, `help-` for support channels, and `social-` for informal discussion. We'll show how prefixes enable quick filtering and mental categorization.

### Separators and Readability
Hyphens vs. underscores vs. camelCase - which works best in Teams? This subsection analyzes readability research and recommends hyphens for maximum clarity in the Teams UI, particularly in the collapsed channel list view.

### Descriptive but Concise Names
Balance between being specific enough to understand at a glance versus keeping names short enough to read in the sidebar. We'll provide formulas like `[prefix]-[team]-[topic]` and show examples of names that hit the sweet spot.

## Channel Taxonomy and Structure
Organizational structure should be reflected in your naming scheme. This section presents a complete taxonomy for enterprise Teams deployments.

### Project Channels
Project channels have a lifecycle - they're created, actively used, then archived. Naming should reflect this: `proj-[client/product]-[shortname]` with optional date suffixes for multi-phase projects. Examples: `proj-acme-website`, `proj-product-launch-q1-2025`.

### Department and Team Channels
Permanent organizational channels need stable names that survive reorganizations. Pattern: `team-[department]-[function]`. Examples: `team-engineering-backend`, `team-marketing-social`, `team-sales-americas`.

### Topic and Community Channels
Cross-functional discussion spaces benefit from clear topic indicators. Pattern: `topic-[subject]` or `comm-[interest]`. Examples: `topic-devops`, `topic-security`, `comm-bookclub`, `comm-running`.

### Temporary and Event Channels
Short-lived channels for events, incidents, or time-bound initiatives should signal their temporary nature. Pattern: `temp-[event]-[date]` or `incident-[id]`. Examples: `temp-offsite-2025-q2`, `incident-api-outage-20250115`.

## Migration from Slack Naming Patterns
If you're moving from Slack, your existing naming conventions may need adaptation. This section provides translation guides for common Slack patterns to Teams equivalents.

### Handling Slack Emoji and Special Characters
Slack allows emoji prefixes (🚀 project-name) while Teams does not. We'll show how to convert visual categorization into text-based prefixes that work in Teams' more constrained namespace.

### Private vs. Public Channel Indicators
Slack uses visual locks; Teams has different privacy models. This subsection covers whether to include privacy indicators in names (e.g., `private-` prefix) or rely on Teams' built-in privacy icons.

### Adapting to Teams' Two-Tier Structure
Slack is flat; Teams has team → channel hierarchy. Channel names can be shorter in Teams since the team name provides context. We'll show examples of flattening Slack's `product-backend-api` to Teams' `backend-api` when it lives in the Product team.
