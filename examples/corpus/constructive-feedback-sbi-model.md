# Constructive Feedback: The SBI Model

*How to give feedback that develops people instead of triggering their defenses*

Most feedback fails because it comes across as judgment rather than observation. We say "you're not communicating well" instead of describing what we actually saw and how it affected the situation. The result? Defensive responses, hurt feelings, and missed opportunities for growth.

The most effective feedback follows a simple pattern: Situation-Behavior-Impact (SBI). This framework transforms difficult conversations into productive dialogue by turning subjective opinions into objective observations that people can actually use.

## Why Most Feedback Fails

Before diving into the solution, let's understand the problem. Most feedback conversations trigger defensiveness because they violate basic principles of effective communication:

### The Attribution Error Trap
We judge others by their actions but ourselves by our intentions. When giving feedback, we often make assumptions about someone's motivations rather than focusing on observable behaviors.

**Instead of**: "You don't care about this project"
**Try**: "In the last three meetings, I noticed you haven't contributed to the discussion about timeline concerns"

### The Judgment Problem
Feedback often sounds like a verdict rather than an observation. This puts people in a defensive position where they feel the need to justify themselves rather than learn.

**Instead of**: "You're bad at presenting"
**Try**: "During today's client presentation, I noticed you looked down at your notes frequently and spoke quietly"

### The Vague Impact Issue
We fail to connect specific behaviors to their actual consequences, leaving people unsure about why the feedback matters.

**Instead of**: "Your communication needs improvement"
**Try**: "When you didn't respond to the urgent Slack message for two hours, the client escalation couldn't be resolved"

## The SBI Framework

The Situation-Behavior-Impact model provides a structure that avoids these common pitfalls:

- **Situation**: Set the context with specific when/where details
- **Behavior**: Describe observable actions without interpretation
- **Impact**: Explain the effect on you, others, or the business

### Why SBI Works

1. **Reduces defensiveness** by avoiding personal attacks or character judgments
2. **Increases clarity** by being specific about what happened and why it matters
3. **Enables learning** by connecting actions to consequences
4. **Shows respect** by treating the person as capable of understanding and improving

## The Three Components Explained

### S: Situation (Set the Context)

**Purpose**: Provide specific context so the person knows exactly what you're referring to.

**What to include**:
- When it happened (date, time, meeting name)
- Where it occurred (specific location or context)
- Who was involved (if relevant to the feedback)

**Example**: "During yesterday's architecture review meeting with the product team..."

### B: Behavior (Describe What You Observed)

**Purpose**: Focus solely on observable actions without interpretation or assumptions about motivation.

**What to include**:
- Specific actions you witnessed
- What was said or done (not why you think they did it)
- Observable facts that could be captured on video

**What to avoid**:
- Mind reading ("you didn't care")
- Character judgments ("you're disorganized")
- Assumptions about intent ("you were trying to undermine me")

### I: Impact (Explain the Consequences)

**Purpose**: Help the person understand why their behavior mattered by connecting it to real consequences.

**What to include**:
- Effect on you personally
- Impact on others present
- Business or project consequences

## Practical Examples

### Positive Recognition Example

**Full SBI Statement:**
"During yesterday's client presentation to Acme Corp, I noticed you anticipated three potential objections and prepared data to address each one before they were even raised. You also adjusted your explanation when you saw confused looks on their faces. As a result, the client seemed much more confident in our approach, and we secured their approval to move to the next phase."

### Corrective Feedback Example

**Full SBI Statement:**
"In this morning's sprint planning meeting, when Sarah was explaining the database performance issue, I noticed you interrupted her twice and started typing on your laptop while she was still talking. This made Sarah visibly frustrated, and the team couldn't get clarity on the performance requirements."

## The Bottom Line

Effective feedback isn't about being nice or being tough - it's about being clear, specific, and helpful. The SBI model:

- **Respects people** by focusing on behaviors rather than character
- **Enables growth** by connecting actions to consequences
- **Builds trust** through objective observation rather than subjective judgment
- **Improves performance** by giving people actionable information they can use

Great teams are built on great feedback. When people feel safe to receive honest observations about their work, they can make the adjustments that turn good performance into exceptional results.
