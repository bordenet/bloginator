# Wiki-style brevity philosophy (used in system prompts)
wiki_brevity_philosophy: |
  WIKI-STYLE BREVITY (ABSOLUTE PRIORITY):
  "Wiki" means QUICK. Humans stop reading bloated content immediately.

  1. ONE CONCEPT PER SECTION - If sources cover 10 things, pick the MOST important one
  2. NO ELABORATION - State the insight once, then STOP. Do not explain, expand, or rephrase
  3. ASSUME INTELLIGENT READER - They don't need hand-holding or verbose transitions
  4. CUT EVERYTHING UNNECESSARY - If deleting a sentence doesn't lose meaning, DELETE IT
  5. ZERO TOLERANCE FOR REDUNDANCY - Saying the same thing twice is complete failure

# Redundancy policy (used in draft and review prompts)
redundancy_policy: |
  ZERO-TOLERANCE REDUNDANCY POLICY:
  If you say the same thing twice in ANY form, you have FAILED completely.

  WITHIN THIS SECTION:
  - One concept = one statement. Period. No rephrasing, no elaboration, no examples "for clarity"
  - If sources repeat the same point, write it ONCE and move on
  - Section description already told the reader the topic - don't repeat it
  - Do NOT pad to reach word count - SHORT is GOOD

  ACROSS ALL SECTIONS:
  - Assume every prior section covered its topic completely
  - NEVER re-explain anything from earlier sections
  - If you must reference prior content: "See [Section Name]" (2 words, not 20)
  - Each section adds ONE new insight, not a recap + new insight

# AI slop detection (used in all prompts)
ai_slop_rules: |
  CRITICAL RULES - NO AI SLOP:
  - NO em-dashes (—) - use commas, periods, or parentheses instead
  - NO flowery language or clichés ("dive deep", "leverage", "at the end of the day")
  - NO hedging words unless present in sources ("perhaps", "maybe", "possibly")
  - NO POWERPOINT BULLETS - write complete sentences or use tables
  - NO "Key Takeaways" sections - integrate insights into prose
  - Match the voice and tone of the source material
  - Be direct and specific, not vague or generic

# Anti-PowerPoint rules (used in draft and review prompts)
anti_powerpoint_rules: |
  ANTI-POWERPOINT RULES (CRITICAL):
  - NEVER use bullet points as a substitute for prose
  - NEVER create slides-style "Key Takeaways" sections
  - NEVER write in sentence fragments or incomplete thoughts
  - NEVER use bullets for lists with only 1-2 items
  - Tables are for DATA, not for avoiding writing complete sentences
  - If you're tempted to make a bulleted list, write a table or a paragraph instead

# Table usage guidelines (used in draft and review prompts)
table_usage_rules: |
  TABLE USAGE (when appropriate):
  Use tables to convey structure and comparisons - they beat long narratives.

  WHEN TO USE TABLES:
  - Comparing 3+ options/approaches/levels with consistent attributes
  - Showing progression (Junior → Senior → Staff expectations)
  - Listing metrics, thresholds, or numeric data
  - Presenting decision criteria or tradeoff matrices

  TABLE REQUIREMENTS:
  - Keep complete - don't sacrifice critical details for brevity
  - 3-5 columns max (more = unreadable)
  - Cells must be dense with info, not sparse placeholders
  - Include all relevant data from sources
  - Prefer tables over 3+ bullet points covering same attributes

# Banned phrases (for quality scoring)
banned_phrases:
  em_dashes:
    pattern: "—"
