# Senior Software Engineer

## About the Role

Senior Software Engineers (Level 3) are experienced individual contributors who own significant features and systems within their team. You'll work independently on complex technical problems, mentor less experienced engineers, and contribute to technical decisions that shape your team's direction.

This role requires 5+ years of software engineering experience with demonstrated technical depth, ownership, and the ability to deliver high-quality solutions with minimal guidance.

## What You'll Do

### Technical Ownership

- Own and deliver complete features from design through deployment
- Design systems and APIs that are maintainable, scalable, and well-documented
- Write clean, efficient code that others can understand and extend
- Identify and fix technical debt before it becomes a critical problem
- Make pragmatic tradeoffs between ideal solutions and business constraints
- Debug complex issues across multiple systems and services

### Team Impact

- Drive technical decisions within your team's scope
- Participate in architecture discussions and design reviews
- Identify low-risk, easily undoable actions and pursue them to completion
- Improve team productivity through better tools, processes, and practices
- Contribute to sprint planning and technical roadmap discussions
- Balance feature delivery with operational excellence

### Mentoring and Collaboration

- Mentor junior and mid-level engineers on your team
- Provide meaningful, insightful code reviews that improve code quality
- Share knowledge through documentation, pairing, and technical discussions
- Participate in recruiting by conducting technical interviews
- Help onboard new team members effectively
- Build trust across your team through consistent delivery and collaboration

## What We're Looking For

### Experience and Background

- 5+ years of professional software engineering experience
- Track record of owning and delivering complex features end-to-end
- Experience with distributed systems and scalable architectures
- History of mentoring and helping other engineers grow
- Demonstrated ability to work independently with minimal guidance

### Technical Competencies

- Strong proficiency in at least one programming language and ecosystem
- Solid understanding of system design, data structures, and algorithms
- Experience with cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, or Azure)
- Knowledge of testing strategies, CI/CD, and deployment practices
- Ability to debug complex issues across the stack
- Understanding of performance optimization and scalability patterns

### Ownership and Delivery

- Proven track record of delivering features on time with high quality
- Ability to break down complex problems into manageable pieces
- Experience estimating work and managing technical risk
- Comfortable making technical decisions with incomplete information
- History of identifying and solving problems proactively
- Focus on outcomes and business impact, not just technical elegance

### Communication and Collaboration

- Clear written and verbal communication skills
- Ability to explain technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders
- Experience working effectively with product managers and designers
- Comfortable giving and receiving constructive feedback
- Active participation in code reviews and technical discussions
- Ability to build consensus within your team
