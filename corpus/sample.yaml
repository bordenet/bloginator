# Sample Corpus Configuration
# ============================
# Uses the publicly available Engineering_Culture repository
# for testing bloginator with real blog content.
#
# Setup:
#   ./scripts/setup-macos.sh  # Downloads Engineering_Culture to test-corpus/
#
# Usage:
#   bloginator extract --config corpus/sample.yaml
#   bloginator index output/extracted -o chroma_db
#   bloginator outline "Your Blog Title" --keywords "keyword1, keyword2"
