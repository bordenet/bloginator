# Quality Levels Explained:
# - preferred: High-quality, authentic voice, use freely for generation
# - reference: Good quality, but use with consideration (may be edited/sanitized)
# - supplemental: Lower quality or off-topic, use sparingly
# - deprecated: Keep for reference but don't use for generation

# Notes on Sources:
# 1. github-personal-blogs: Most recent, safest for public consumption
# 2. telepathy-labs (both): Professional technical writing, authentic voice
# 3. istreamplanet: Historical technical blog posts, specialized domain knowledge
# 4. NAS vs OneDrive: NAS has working copies, OneDrive has archives
